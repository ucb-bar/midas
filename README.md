# MIDAS Beta v0.1

MIDAS is an FPGA simulation simulation framework that automatically generates FPGA simulators for various FPGA platforms from any RTL designs. MIDAS is an improvement over [Strober](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3001151) that was originally developed for sample-based energy simulation.

## Dependencies

This repo depends on the following projects:
* [Chisel](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3): RTL implementations in MIDAS/Strober are written with Chisel
* [FIRRTL](https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl): Custom transforms in MIDAS/Strober are written with FIRRTL
* [RocketChip](https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip.git): RocketChip is not only a chip generator, but also a collection of useful libraries for various hardware designs. We take advantage of some libraries in RocketChip.
* [barstools](https://github.com/ucb-bar/barstools): Technology dependent custom transforms(e.g. macro compiler) are used for Strober.

Thie repo is not supposed to work alone. It is instantiated in top-level projects with target designs such as [strober-examples](https://github.com/donggyukim/strober-examples) and [midas-top](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-top.git).

## Get Started

### MIDAS Compiler

First of all, we assume the target design is written in Chisel. To generate the FPGA simulator for the target design, just pass the target design with a configuration to `MidasCompiler`:
```scala
// mod: Module (target design)
// dir: File (target directory)
// p: config.Parameters (midas configuration)
midas.MidasCompiler(mod, dir)(p)
```

If you have a JSON file describing the target technology generated by [PLSI](https://github.com/ucb-bar/hammer), pass it as:
```scala
// lib: File (technology description)
midas.MidasCompiler(mod, dir, Some(lib))(p)
```

Here are two examples in [strober-example](https://github.com/donggyukim/strober-examples/blob/master/src/main/scala/Main.scala) and [midas-top](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-top/blob/master/src/main/scala/Generator.scala#L161).

### MIDAS Configurations

The default MIDAS parameters are given in [src/main/scala/midas/Config.scala](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas/blob/readme/src/main/scala/midas/Config.scala). You can just pass `ZynqConfig` to obtain performance simulation and `ZynqConfigWithSnapshot` to plug Strober in for power/energy simulation for Xilinx Zynq boards.

You may want to override some parameters on top of the default parameter values. This is an example how you can instantiate an MIDAS LLC model:
```scala
class WithMidasLLC(extends Config((site, here, up) => {
  case MidasLLCKey => Some(MidasLLCParameters(nWays = 8, nSets = 4096, blockBytes = 128)) // capacity <= 4MiB
})

class ZynqConfigWithLLC(new ZynqConfig ++ new WithMidasLLC)
```

### MIDAS Software Driver

To take control of FPGA simulation, the software driver is suppposed to be written in C++ by the users. The simplest way to write is use `peek`, `poke`, `step`, `expect` functions as in Chisel testers. The first step is write a virtual class shared by emulation and various platforms. This is a software driver for GCD (e.g. in `GCD.h`) by inheriting `simif_t` as an example:
```c++
#include "simif.h"

class GCD_t: virtual simif_t
{
public:
  void run() {
    uint32_t a = 64, b = 48, z = 16; //test vectors
    target_reset();
    do {
      poke(io_a, a);
      poke(io_b, b);
      poke(io_e, cycles() == 0 ? 1 : 0);
      step(1);
    } while (cycles() <= 1 || peek(io_v) == 0);
    expect(io_z, z);
  }
};
```

Next, to emulate and test the FPGA simulator itself, a drieved class is written (e.g. in `GCD-emul.cc`) as follow:

```c++
#include "simif_emul.h"
#include "GCD.h"

class GCD_emul_t:
  public simif_emul_t,
  public GCD_t { };

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  GCD_emul_t GCD;
  GCD.init(argc, argv, true);
  GCD.run();
  return GCD.finish();
}
```

For FPGA simulation in Xilinx Zynq, the code (e.g. in `GCD-zynq.cc`) is written in the same way inheriting `simif_zynq_t` instead of `simif_emul_t`:

```c++
#include "simif_zynq.h"
#include "GCD.h"

class GCD_zynq_t:
  public simif_zynq_t,
  public GCD_t { };

int main(int argc, char** argv) 
{
  GCD_zynq_t GCD;
  GCD.init(argc, argv, true);
  GCD.run();
  return GCD.finish();
}
```

In this way, we can reduce lots of code duplication for emulation and various platforms when the software driver becomes complicated.

Big numbers more than 64 bits can be defined by `mpz_t` in [GMP](https://gmplib.org/), and passed to `peek`, `poke`, `expect` functions.

To compile the driver, `make` is invoked in `src/main/cc`. Thus, the top-level makefile is likely to contain the wrapper as follows:
```makefile
compile-driver:
  $(MAKE) -C $(midas_dir)/src/main/cc [verilator | vcs | zynq] [variable="<value>"]*
```

The variables are:
* `PLATFORM`: Platform name (zynq by default)
* `DESIGN`: Target design name
* `GEN_DIR`: The directory containing generated files from MIDAS Compiler (=`dir`)
* `OUT_DIR`: The directory for output files (`GEN_DIR` by default)
* `DRIVER`: The driver files written by the user (not including header files)
* `CXXFLAGS`: additional compiler flags

### FPGA Simulation Synthesis

To compile the FPGA simulator, platform specific backend flows are provided. For now, [the Xilinx Zynq backend](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-zynq) is supported by modifying [RocketChip fpga-zynq](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-zynq).

### Run emulation / FPGA simulation

To run emulation / FPGA simulation, simply run:
```
cd <output_dir>
./[binary executable] [+<argument>=<value>]
```

The argument list is as follows:
* `+mm_MEM_LATENCY=`: the DRAM latency (required)
* `+mm_LLC_LATENCY=`: the LLC latency (required when using the LLC model)
* `+mm_LLC_WAY_BITS=`: log2(#(LLC ways)) (required when using the LLC model)
* `+mm_LLC_SET_BITS=`: log2(#(LLC sets)) (required when using the LLC model)
* `+mm_LLC_BLOCK_BITS=`: log2(#(LLC block size)) (required when using the LLC model)
* `+loadmem=`: hex file to initialize the main memory
* `+fastloadmem`: enables fast loadmem, not through the loadmem unit (emulation only)
* `+seed=`: seed value for the random generator (optional)
* `+sample=`: file name for sample snapshots (strober only)
* `+samplenum=`: number of sample snapshots (strober only)
* `+tracelen=`: the length of I/O traces (strober only)

Note that emulation and FPGA simulation share most command-line arguments.

### Templates / Examples

There are two templates you can start with:
* [strober-example](https://github.com/donggyukim/strober-examples.git): Strober for very simple and small examples.
* [midas-top](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-zynq.git): MIDAS/Strober for RocketChip and BOOM.

## Internal Architecture

This section describes the internal architecture of MIDAS for advanced users.

### Custom Transforms in the MIDAS Complier

The [`MidasTransforms`](src/main/scala/midas/passes/MidasTransforms.scala) composes custom compiler passes to generate FPGA simulators as follows:
![transforms](doc/images/transforms.png)

Note that the MIDAS compiler operates on low firrtl to take advantage of low-level optimizations from the FIRRTL compiler.

### Macro Mapping (Optional)

*Macro Mapping* maps technology-independent macro blocks to technology-dependent macro blocks(SRAMs). This pass is initiated by passing the JSON description to the MIDAS compiler. For implementation details, refer to [barstools](https://github.com/ucb-bar/barstools).

### FAME1 Transform
[*FAME1 transform*](src/main/scala/midas/passes/Fame1Transform.scala) decouples the target clock from the host clock by attaching enable signals to all state elements. This enables FPGA performance simulators to stall when timing tokens are not ready. With FAME1 transforms, we can easily control the execution of FPGA simulation with timing token flow controls. The details of this transform are found in [the ISCA'16 paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3001151).

### Scan Chain Insertion (Optional)
[*Scan chain insertion*](src/main/scala/strober/passes/AddDaisyChain.scala) add scan chains to take RTL state snapshots for sample replays. Notably, [*all scan chains are implemented in Chisel*](src/main/scala/strober/core/DaisyChain.scala), and this pass compiles the Chisel designs by invoking the FIRRTL compiler inside a FIRRTL pass. This technique, called *Inline Compilation*, removes the necessity of writing all hardware logic with IR, reducing the pass writing overhead significantly. In addtion, the scan chain information is dumped (e.g. `<design>.chain`) by [another compiler pass](src/main/scala/strober/passes/DumpChain.scala). The details of scan chains are found in [the ISCA'16 paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3001151).

### Simulation Mapping
[*Simulation mapping*](src/main/scala/midas/passes/SimulationMapping.scala) wraps the transformed target design by inserting timing token channels / trace buffers. The result is a platform-independent simulation module for token-based simulation. This pass compiles [the wrapper written in Chisel](src/main/scala/midas/core/SimWrapper.scala) with *Inline Compilation*. The details on communication channels and token-based simulation are found in [the ISCA'16 paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3001151).

### Platform Mapping
[*Platform mapping*](src/main/scala/midas/passes/PlatformMapping.scala), the heart of MIDAS, links all simulation modules hosted on FPGA with platform specific logic. First of all, [`FPGATop`](src/main/scala/midas/core/FPGATop.scala) instantiates and connects abstrace modules and helpers implemented using [`Widget`](src/main/scala/midas/widgets) as well as the target module generated by simulation mapping. Next, there are [platform-specific shims](src/main/scala/midas/platform) to adapt the AXI master-slave interface to the platform-specific interfaces. As a final step, the compiler pass compiles the platform shim with *Inline Compilation*, dumps a target and platform specific C++ header file (`<design>-const.h`) for the software driver, and thus, generates the FPGA simulator.

## Advanced Usage

### Endpoint

The easiest way to write a testbench for the software driver is use `poke`, `peek`, `expect` for each I/O port along with `step`. However, this may not be proper in many situations as it increases communication overhead between the FPGA and the software driver. Thus, we introduce [`Endpoint`](src/main/scala/midas/core/Endpoints.scala) that translates the tokens into higher-level transactions and vice versa through [a specialized `Widget`](src/main/scala/midas/widgets/NastiIO.scala). The intuition behind is the systems we are building are nicely divided into FPGA and software sush that the commucations between them are rare (e.g. through decoupled channels). Note that [the memory timing model](src/main/scala/midas/widgets/SimpleLatencyPipe.scala) is an example endpoint. We also have examples in midas-top ([scala code](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-top/tree/master/src/main/scala/endpoints), [c++ code](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-top/tree/master/src/main/cc/endpoints)) you can easily follow on.

First, implement a custom endpoint widget.

Next, define `matchType` and `widget` in the inherited class of [`Endpoint`](src/main/scala/midas/core/Endpoints.scala). The `matchType` method finds the top-level I/O ports that the endpoint widget operates on. The `widget` method instantiates the endpoint widget.
