# MIDAS

MIDAS is an FPGA simulation simulation framework that automatically generates platform agnostic FPGA simulators from any RTL designs. MIDAS is an improvement over [Strober](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3001151) that was originally implemented for sample-based energy simulation.

## Dependencies

This repo depends on the following projects:
* [Chisel](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3): RTL implementations in MIDAS/Strober are written with Chisel
* [FIRRTL](https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl): Custom transforms in MIDAS/Strober are written with FIRRTL
* [RocketChip](https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip.git): RocketChip is not only a chip generator, but also a collection of useful libraries for various hardware designs. We take advantage of some libraries in RocketChip.
* [barstools](https://github.com/ucb-bar/barstools): Technology dependent custom transforms(e.g. macro compiler) are used for Strober.

Thie repo is not supposed to work alone. It is instantiated in top-level projects with target designs such as [strober-examples](https://github.com/donggyukim/strober-examples) and [midas-top](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-top.git).

## How to Use?
To generate the Verilog file of the FPGA simulator, just pass the target design with a configuration:
```scala
// mod: Module (target design)
// dir: File (target directory)
// p: config.Parameters (midas configuration)
midas.MidasCompiler(mod, dir)(p)
```

If you have a JSON file describing the target technology generated by [PLSI](https://github.com/ucb-bar/hammer), pass it as:
```scala
// lib: File (technology description)
midas.MidasCompiler(mod, dir, Some(lib))(p)
```

Here are two examples in [strober-example](https://github.com/donggyukim/strober-examples/blob/master/src/main/scala/Main.scala) and [midas-top](https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-top/blob/master/src/main/scala/Generator.scala#L161).
